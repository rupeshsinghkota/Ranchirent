# Lead Management Strategy: "From Contact to Closing"

You asked: *"I don't understand how I will manage leads, what's your thought after they contact?"*

This is the most critical part of your business. The website gets them to the door; your **Process** gets them to pay. Since you are starting lean, we will avoid expensive CRMs (Salesforce, Zoho) and use **Google Sheets + WhatsApp Business**.

Here is the exact workflow you should follow.

---

## **Phase 1: The "Incoming" (Capture)**
Your website is set up to capture leads in two ways:
1.  **Forms**: They fill out the "Book Visit" form -> Data goes to **Google Sheets**.
2.  **Direct Call/WhatsApp**: They click the "Call Now" button -> You get a call directly.

### **Action Plan:**
*   **Morning Routine**: Check your `RanchiRent Leads` Google Sheet every morning (or turn on email notifications for the sheet).
*   **Response Time**: Speed is money. If you call them within **5 minutes**, your conversion chance is 10x higher.

---

## **Phase 2: The "Filter" (Qualification)**
Not every lead is good. You need to filter them quickly so you don't waste time showing flats to people who won't buy.

**When you call them, ask these 3 "Golden Questions":**
1.  *"When are you planning to shift?"* (If they say "next week" = HOT. If "maybe next year" = COLD).
2.  *"What is your budget?"* (Verify if they can actually afford the flat they asked for).
3.  *"Who will stay?"* (Family vs Bachelors - Filter based on owner preference).

### **Labeling System (In Google Sheets)**
Add a `Status` column in your Google Sheet and select one:
*   🟢 **New**: Just arrived, hasn't been called.
*   🟡 **Interested / Hot**: Picking up call, has budget, wants to visit.
*   🔴 **Disqualified**: Budget too low, or "just browsing".
*   🔵 **Scheduled**: Site visit date confirmed.
*   ⚫ **Closed**: Deal done, commission received.

## **Phase 3: The "Action" (Site Visit)**
This is where the sale happens.
1.  **Schedule**: Agree on a specific time. Send a **WhatsApp Calendar Invite** or just a text confirmation:
    > *"Hello [Name], Confirming our visit for [Flat Name] at [Location] tomorrow at 4 PM. see you there! - RanchiRent"*
2.  **The Visit**: Use your **Verification Checklist** (from the previous step) to show you are professional. Show them the amenities you verified.

---

## **Phase 4: The "Close" (Agreement)**
If they like it:
1.  **Token Amount**: Ask for a small token (e.g., ₹2000) to "block" the flat immediately. This stops them from shopping around.
2.  **Police Verification**: Collect their ID proofs (Aadhaar/PAN).
3.  **Rent Agreement**: You (the broker/platform) facilitate the agreement between Owner and Tenant.

## **Tools You Need Now**

### **1. WhatsApp Business App (Free)**
Don't use personal WhatsApp.
*   **Labels**: Use color labels for "New Lead", "Visit Pending", "Paid".
*   **Quick Replies**: Save messages like *"Hi, thanks for contacting RanchiRent. Can I call you in 10 mins?"* so you don't type it every time.

### **2. The "Master Sheet"**
We have already set up the code for this. Your Google Sheet will be your central command center.
*   **Tab 1**: Web Inquiries (Automatic).
*   **Tab 2**: Verification Database (Your property bank).

### **Summary of Daily Workflow**
1.  Phone rings / Sheet updates.
2.  Call them -> Qualify (Budget/Date).
3.  Add "Label" in WhatsApp/Sheet.
4.  Schedule Visit.
5.  Close & Collect Commission.
